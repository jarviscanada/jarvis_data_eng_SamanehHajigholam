## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SamanehHajigholam](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SamanehHajigholam)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SamanehHajigholam/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Linux-based cluster monitoring system to collect and analyze CPU, memory, and disk usage across multiple servers running Rocky Linux 9. Implemented automated metric collection using Bash scripts and cron jobs, storing time-series data in a Dockerized PostgreSQL database for consistency and portability. The solution centralized system performance data and enabled efficient tracking of resource usage across nodes.

**SQL Analytics** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SamanehHajigholam/tree/master/sql)]: Implemented data modeling and SQL queries (joins, aggregation, filtering, string operations) using a Dockerized PostgreSQL instance. Reinforced analytical concepts through hands-on practice in relational database design and performance optimization.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SamanehHajigholam/tree/master/core_java)]: Grep App: Built a Java-based CLI application similar to Linux grep that recursively searches directories using regex patterns and outputs matching lines. Applied object-oriented design, file I/O with buffered readers, and logging via SLF4J/Log4j. Packaged the app as a Fat JAR with Maven and containerized it using Docker for consistent deployment.

**Python Data Analytics** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SamanehHajigholam/tree/master/python_data_anlytics)]: Analyzed two years of real-world retail transaction data to uncover customer purchasing patterns and support data-driven marketing strategies. Built a reproducible analytics workflow using Dockerized PostgreSQL and Jupyter Notebook, and performed data cleaning, validation, and feature engineering with Python, Pandas, and NumPy. Implemented customer-level metrics and RFM segmentation while handling production data challenges such as cancellations, missing values, and duplicated frequency distributions. Delivered actionable insights to identify high-value and at-risk customers, enabling targeted promotions and retention strategies.


## Highlighted Projects
**PL/SQL Data Management System** [[GitHub](https://github.com/shajigholam/PL-SQL-Football-Leagues)]: Built and optimized stored procedures, triggers, and reporting views across multiple relational tables (Players, Teams, Rosters). Demonstrated proficiency in SQL logic, data relationships, and analytical reporting automation.

**Full-Stack E-Commerce Website** [[GitHub](https://github.com/shajigholam/Bulky)]: Built an e-commerce web app using ASP.NET Core MVC, SQL Server, and Azure deployment.  It allows administrators to manage orders, users, and products efficiently.
